## Overview
Open Targets is an innovative, large-scale, multi-year, public-private partnership that uses human genetics and genomics data to allow systematic drug target identification and prioritisation. We currently focus on oncology, immunology, respiratory and neurodegenerative disease through an R&D framework that can be applied to all aspects of human disease. We share our data openly with the scientific community welcome new partners who share our philosophies and scientific interests.


Open Targets brings together expertise from four complementary institutions to systematically identify and prioritise targets from which safe and effective medicines can be developed.

To find a good therapeutic hypothesis we need to know which targets are involved in disease, how we might alter complex disease mechanisms, and how predictive laboratory and animal results are for humans.  We believe that evidence generated in the most human relevant systems showing which targets are causing disease will have a significant impact on successful development of new medicines. 

Generating and interpreting this evidence demands a diverse set of skills, backgrounds, data types and technologies, which do not exist today in any single entity. Open Targets unique capabilities address these challenges through the following high-level goals:
* Systematically use the latest genetics, human cell models and data analyses to find the best targets to safely & effectively treat disease
*	Prove these targets through adoption & progression in drug discovery pipelines
*	Openly share our results & methods to help others find new target opportunities
