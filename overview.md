Open Targets is a public-private initiative established in 2014 to use extensive human genetics and genomics data to transform drug discovery through systematic targets identification and prioritisation, and share its data openly with the scientific community. It is an innovative, large-scale, multi-year alliance that fully exploits genomic information to provide an R&D framework that can be applied to all aspects of human disease. We currently focus on oncology, immunology, respiratory and neurodegenerative disease. Open Targets is a growing endeavour and welcomes new partners who share its philosophies and scientific interests to work together to transform target identification and prioritisation.


Open Targets brings together expertise from four complementary institutions to systematically identify and prioritise targets from which safe and effective medicines can be developed.

The challenges in selecting a good target include insufficient knowledge about whether targets are involved in disease, how to alter complex disease mechanisms, and whether laboratory assays and animal studies will translate to successful clinical trials. We believe that mechanistic evidence in humans on causal links between targets and diseases will have a significant impact on successful development of new medicines. Generating and interpreting this evidence demands a diverse set of skills, backgrounds, data types and technologies, which do not exist today in any single entity. Open Targets unique capabilities address these challenges through the following high-level objectives:
1.	Identify and validate causal links between targets, pathways and diseases based on combining human based evidence in a multidisciplinary approach.
2.	Develop a standardized infrastructure that allows users to make data-driven decisions based on diverse, interconnected information about target and disease biology gathered in a single place.
3.	Have a substantial scientific impact in the research community, in particular by releasing new informatics tools, experimental methods, platforms, and associated data related to target validation according to the principles of open data sharing and knowledge exchange.

Our partnership works towards these objectives with the following principles:

## Core principles
* We are focused on pre-competitive research that will enable the systematic identification and prioritisation of targets.
* We are committed to rapid publication and making data, methods and results publically available as soon as possible.
* We believe in non-exclusive partnerships that foster the free exchange of ideas and expertise
