          <p>
            The COVID-19 Target Prioritisation Tool is an interactive, open source web portal that integrates molecular and clinical data from 
            EMBL-EBI and other public resources to provide an evidence-based framework to support decision-making on potential drug targets 
            and treatments for <a href="https://alpha.targetvalidation.org/disease/MONDO_0100096" target="_blank">COVID-19</a>.

          <p>
            Project Score is a web portal that allows researchers to explore the results of CRISPR-Cas9 whole-genome 
            drop out screens across a diverse collection of human cancer cell models and to identify dependencies in 
            cancer cells to help guide precision cancer medicines. For more information, please see the supporting publication

          <p>
            The eQTL Catalogue aims to provide uniformly processed gene expression and splicing QTLs from all available 
            public studies on human. This resource focuses on expression cis-QTLs (cis-eQTL) where variants are associated 
            to expression levels of nearby genes, and on splicing QTLs (sQTL) where variants are associated to specific 
            splicing events on nearby splice junctions.

            CHEERS (Chromatin Element Enrichment Ranking by Specificity) is a method to determine enrichment of annotations in GWAS significant loci. 
            In addition to SNP-peak overlap, CHEERS takes into account peak properties as reflected by quantitative changes in read counts within peaks.

          <p>
            Naïve CD4+ T cells coordinate the immune response by acquiring an effector phenotype in response to cytokines. 
            Here, we used quantitative proteomics, bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq of over 40,000 human naïve and memory 
            CD4+ T cells to generate a detailed map of cytokine-regulated gene expression programs. See

            epiChoose is an application for quantifying the relatedness between cell lines and primary cells. 
            We have extensively profiled a number of commonly used cell line models across a number of tissues. 
            This profiling consists of epigenetic (histone modification, CTCF, ATAC-seq) and transcriptional 
            (RNA-seq) whole-genome measurements.

            CELLector is a computational tool implemented in an open source R Shiny application and R package that allows researchers to 
            select the most relevant cancer cell lines in a genomic-guided fashion. CELLector leverages tumour genomics data to explore, rank, and select optimal cell line models, 
            enabling scientists to make appropriate and informed choices about model inclusion/exclusion in retrospective analyses and future studies. See

            DoRothEA (Discriminant Regulon Expression Analysis) is a research resource that can be used to search 
            candidate TF-drug interactions in cancer. Due to their location as downstream effectors of signalling pathways, 
            aberrant activities in upstream driver genes (even if not mutated) will cause altered TF activities, thus 
            proposing TFs as sensors of pathway dysregulation and alternative markers. Please see

          <p>
            A new tool called LINK (LIterature coNcept Knowledgebase) has been developed that allows the exploration of 
            half a billion relations between genes, diseases, drugs and key concepts extracted from PubMed abstracts using 
            NLP (Natural Language Processing). Once MEDLINE relaxed their license for obtaining and analysing publication data,
            we started looking for novel ways to mine their data. We wanted to exploit the biomedical knowledge often buried 
            in the literature to help scientists generate new hypotheses for the identification of new drug targets. For this 
            purpose, we have built Library, an open source ecosystem comprising: a pipeline that allows us to quickly run a
            large-scale NLP analysis; an API that serves the resulting data; and a user interface to explore the data. Our 
            pipeline annotates genes, diseases and drugs present in PubMed abstracts, and extracts key concepts. Please see

          <p>
          Genome editing by CRISPR-Cas9 technology allows large-scale screening of gene essentiality in cancer. 
          A confounding factor when interpreting CRISPR-Cas9 screens is the high false-positive rate in detecting 
          essential genes within copy number amplified regions of the genome. We have developed the computational 
          tool CRISPRcleanR which is capable of identifying and correcting gene-independent responses to CRISPR-Cas9 
          targeting. CRISPRcleanR uses an unsupervised approach based on the segmentation of single-guide RNA fold 
          change values across the genome, without making any assumption about the copy number status of the 
          targeted genes. CRISPRcleanR is implemented as an R package and as an interactive Python package with 
          full documentation, tutorials, built in datasets to reproduce the results in this manuscript, and is 
          publically available as an <a href="https://github.com/francescojm/CRISPRcleanR" target="_blank">R package</a> 
          and as a <a href="https://github.com/cancerit/pyCRISPRcleanR" target="_blank">Python package</a>. 
          The Python implementation is dockerised making it platform-independent and 
          <a href="https://dockstore.org/containers/quay.io/wtsicgp/dockstore-pycrisprcleanr" target="_blank">usable in cloud environments</a>.
