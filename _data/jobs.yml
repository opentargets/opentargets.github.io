    We are seeking a motivated and experienced scientist in cancer molecular biology and genetics to lead the expansion and curation of the Cancer Gene Census at the Wellcome Sanger Institute within COSMIC, 
    a database of genetic mutations in cancer, a major resource in cancer research, widely used across informatics, diagnostic and pharmaceutical industries. This is an exciting position within the COSMIC team, 
    where you will have the opportunity to explore & interpret a wide range of literature, database and analytic resources to create a complete landscape of genetic dysfunctions across all cancer types and explain 
    which molecular mechanisms are most important in development of these diseases. Our first aim is to expand the Cancer Gene Census with new genes, and to generate full descriptive coverage of all Census genes 
    with evidence of oncogenic activity. The Cancer Gene Census is frequently cited in publications and regularly used as a key data source in cancer genome analytics and databases; this project extends this 
    high-profile resource, offering multiple opportunities for very citeable publications. This position is available for 18 months with a possibility of extension.

    identify new genes involved in neurodegeneration, especially Alzheimer’s disease. The successful candidate will use human 
    induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) derived microglia coupled with cutting edge high-throughput single cell 'omics techniques 
    to assay the effects of natural and induced genetic variation on gene expression and cellular phenotypes. The overall aim is to 
    identify novel genes involved in important microglial cellular processes that are relevant for disease biology and will therefore 
    be candidate drug targets for further development.
