    The <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/group/parts-group/" target="_blank">Parts lab</a> at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, in collaboration with Andrew Bassett (Sanger) and Florian Merkle (Cambridge), 
    is seeking a highly motivated researcher with strong computational and quantitative skills to fill a postdoctoral fellow position. This role is focused on identifying new drug targets 
    for neurodegenerative disorders using novel data from CRISPR + scRNAseq experiments and accumulated public datasets. Your projects will stem from the intersection of high-throughput 
    single cell RNA sequencing, genetic perturbations via CRISPR/Cas, stem cell derived neuronal cell types, and external evidence to prioritize and understand genes that drive neurodegeneration.
