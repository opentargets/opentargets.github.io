    The Human Technopole is seeking a highly motivated researcher to fill a Postdoctoral Fellow 
    position in the <a href="https://humantechnopole.it/en/research-groups/iorio-group/" target="_blank">group led by Francesco Iorio <a/>
    within the <a href="https://humantechnopole.it/en/research-centres/computational-biology/" target="_blank">Centre for Computational Biology</a>. 
    The project aims to identify new oncology therapeutic targets and perform in silico drug prescriptions 
    based on the analysis of functional genomics and patient data. More specifically, the role will develop 
    new algorithms and methods (and will extend existing computational tools) for calibrating thousands 
    of cancer in vitro models (encompassing cell lines and 3D organoids, across tens of tissue lineages 
    and cancer types) onto suitably represented cancer patients' sub-populations, 
    via integrated analyses of data from their multi-omics characterisations and clinical prior knowledge.
