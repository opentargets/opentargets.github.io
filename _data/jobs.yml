    The <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/group/parts-group/" target="_blank">Parts lab</a> at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, in collaboration with Andrew Bassett (Sanger) and Florian Merkle (Cambridge), 
    is seeking a highly motivated researcher with strong computational and quantitative skills to fill a postdoctoral fellow position. This role is focused on identifying new drug targets 
    for neurodegenerative disorders using novel data from CRISPR + scRNAseq experiments and accumulated public datasets. Your projects will stem from the intersection of high-throughput 
    single cell RNA sequencing, genetic perturbations via CRISPR/Cas, stem cell derived neuronal cell types, and external evidence to prioritize and understand genes that drive neurodegeneration.

    A position is now available for a highly motivated Postdoctoral Fellow to join the research group of Ana Cvejic, Peter Campbell and Open Targets partners at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI).
    The project will combine state-of-the-art single-cell data generation with spatial transcriptomics to study the spatial distribution of diverse immune cells in cancer, and discover putative 
    cell-cell interactions across the tumour microenvironment. This position could be based at the Wellcome Sanger Institute or at the University of Cambridge in Ana Cvejic's lab.
