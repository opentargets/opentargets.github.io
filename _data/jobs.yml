    We have an opportunity for a postdoctoral researcher to join an interdisciplinary team of experimental and computational, and academic and drug discovery researchers. 
    The aim of the project is to develop better cellular models of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and use the models to validate IBD risk genes identified by the 
    computational arm of the <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/group/anderson-group/" target="_blank">Anderson Lab</a>.
    This is an exciting opportunity for you to apply cutting-edge technology, including induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), intestinal organoids, CRISPR/Cas genome editing, and single cell RNA-sequencing. 
    You will differentiate iPSC carrying IBD risk alleles to intestinal organoids, and will stimulate them with cytokines to better mimic the inflammatory environment of the gut in IBD. Cells from primary intestinal organoids and iPSC-derived intestinal organoids will be prepared for single cell RNA-sequencing using the 10X Genomics Chromium platform. Data will be analysed and IBD gene mechanism will be dissected using functional assays.

    We have an opportunity for a postdoctoral fellow to join us under the leadership of Dr Ana Cvejic (Wellcome Sanger Institute) 
    and Peter Campbell (WSI). In this project, you will analyse newly generated single cell (scRNA-Seq and scATAC-Seq) as well as 
    novel and spatial transcriptomics data sets (In Situ Sequencing and 10x Visium) to understand the molecular properties of 
    immune cells infiltrating tumour sites. The underlying data sets comprise thousands of unique molecular signals measured for 
    tens of thousands of cells or physical locations in each tumour. You will employ methods from high dimensional and spatial 
    statistics, and machine learning, to chart and understand the nature of different tumour-associated immune cells, how they 
    interact and change biological functions and how the underlying molecular changes could be exploited as therapeutic targets.
