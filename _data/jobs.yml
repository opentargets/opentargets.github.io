    The <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/group/parts-group/" target="_blank">Parts lab</a> at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, in collaboration with Andrew Bassett (Sanger) and Florian Merkle (Cambridge), 
    is seeking a highly motivated researcher with strong computational and quantitative skills to fill a postdoctoral fellow position. This role is focused on identifying new drug targets 
    for neurodegenerative disorders using novel data from CRISPR + scRNAseq experiments and accumulated public datasets. Your projects will stem from the intersection of high-throughput 
    single cell RNA sequencing, genetic perturbations via CRISPR/Cas, stem cell derived neuronal cell types, and external evidence to prioritize and understand genes that drive neurodegeneration.

    A position is now available for a highly motivated Postdoctoral Fellow to join the research group of Ana Cvejic, Peter Campbell and Open Targets partners at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI).
    The project will combine state-of-the-art single-cell data generation with spatial transcriptomics to study the spatial distribution of diverse immune cells in cancer, and discover putative 
    cell-cell interactions across the tumour microenvironment. This position could be based at the Wellcome Sanger Institute or at the University of Cambridge in Ana Cvejic's lab.

    We have an opportunity for a postdoctoral fellow to join us under the leadership of Dr Ana Cvejic (Wellcome Sanger Institute) 
    and Peter Campbell (WSI). In this project, you will analyse newly generated single cell (scRNA-Seq and scATAC-Seq) as well as 
    novel and spatial transcriptomics data sets (In Situ Sequencing and 10x Visium) to understand the molecular properties of 
    immune cells infiltrating tumour sites. The underlying data sets comprise thousands of unique molecular signals measured for 
    tens of thousands of cells or physical locations in each tumour. You will employ methods from high dimensional and spatial 
    statistics, and machine learning, to chart and understand the nature of different tumour-associated immune cells, how they 
    interact and change biological functions and how the underlying molecular changes could be exploited as therapeutic targets.
