    We are looking for a postdoctoral fellow to join an Open Targets project under the leadership of Dr Ana Cvejic (Wellcome Sanger Institute), Moritz Gerstung (EBI), and Omer Bayraktar (WSI).
    In this project you will analyse newly single cell (scRNA-Seq and scATAC-Seq) as well as novel and spatial transcriptomics data sets (In Situ Sequencing and 10x visium) generated in the Cvejic 
    and Bayraktar labs to understand the molecular properties of immune cells infiltrating tumour sites. The underlying data sets comprise thousands of unique molecular signals measured for tens of 
    thousands of cells or physical locations in each tumour. You will employ methods from high dimensional and spatial statistics developed in the Gerstung group to chart and understand the nature of 
    different tumour-associated immune cells, how they interact and change biological functions and how the underlying molecular changes could be exploited as therapeutic targets.

    The EBI–Sanger Postdoctoral (ESPOD) Programme builds on the collaborative relationship between EMBL-EBI and the Wellcome Sanger Institute, offering projects that combine experimental (wet-lab) and computational (dry-lab) approaches.
    The project, Investigation of genetic signatures associated with pharmacological outcomes for immune diseases, will be supervised by Ellen McDonagh (Informatics Science Director - Open Targets ), Gosia Trynka (Experimental Science Director - Open Targets),
    and Emma Davenport (Group Leader, Functional Genomics - Sanger). For more information, please review the <a href='https://www.ebi.ac.uk/sites/ebi.ac.uk/files/shared/ESPOD_2020_McDonagh_Trynka_Davenport.pdf' target='_blank'>project description</a>.
