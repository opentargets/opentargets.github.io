    The Human Technopole is seeking a highly motivated researcher to fill a Postdoctoral Fellow 
    position in the <a href="https://humantechnopole.it/en/research-groups/iorio-group/" target="_blank">group led by Francesco Iorio <a/>
    within the <a href="https://humantechnopole.it/en/research-centres/computational-biology/" target="_blank">Centre for Computational Biology</a>. 
    The project aims to identify new oncology therapeutic targets and perform in silico drug prescriptions 
    based on the analysis of functional genomics and patient data. More specifically, the role will develop 
    new algorithms and methods (and will extend existing computational tools) for calibrating thousands 
    of cancer in vitro models (encompassing cell lines and 3D organoids, across tens of tissue lineages 
    and cancer types) onto suitably represented cancer patients' sub-populations, 
    via integrated analyses of data from their multi-omics characterisations and clinical prior knowledge.

    The <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/research/petsalaki">Petsalaki Group at EMBL-EBI</a>  is looking to recruit a Postdoctoral Fellow
    to work on a project to identify combination targets for KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer and triple negative breast cancer. 
    You will be working in collaboration with the team to analyse the largest genetic interaction dataset generated to date in 
    human cell lines (75K pairs across 50 cell lines) in order to prioritise candidate target pairs for therapeutic applications, 
    understand the mechanisms and principles underpinning these genetic interactions. Additionally you will have the opportunity to 
    develop a predictive model of drug synergy that is also interpretable in terms of mechanism of action.
