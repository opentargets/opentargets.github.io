    An exciting opportunity has been created for a talented scientist to work on the 
    development of new methodologies to identify relevant bioactivity data from the 
    literature and other sources for incorporation into the world-leading ChEMBL database. 
    This work will directly contribute to two on-going projects. 
    The first, BioChemGraph, is supported by the BBSRC and aims to enhance data integration 
    between the ChEMBL, PDBe and CSD databases. The second project is sponsored by Open 
    Targets and will deliver evidence linking specific protein targets to disease phenotypes.
