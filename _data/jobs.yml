    The <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/programme/human-genetics/" target="_blank">Human Genetics programme</a> 
    at the Wellcome Sanger Institute is looking for an Advanced Research Assistant to 
    join the interdisciplinary highly collaborative team of academics, clinicians and drug discovery researchers.
    This is an exciting opportunity to apply single cell genomics to cells isolated from patients with inflammatory 
    bowel disease (IBD) or healthy control patients. The goal of the project is to identify genetic variants that are 
    associated with gene expression in intestinal cells, and then combine these with data from genetic studies of IBD 
    patients to identify potential novel drug targets for IBD.
