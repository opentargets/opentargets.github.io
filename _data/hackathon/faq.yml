# FAQ data for Open Targets Hackathon

- question: What is Open Targets?
  answer: Open Targets is a public-private partnership that uses human genetics and genomics data for systematic drug target identification and prioritization. The consortium brings together expertise from academia, industry, and technology to transform the way drug discovery is done, making it more efficient and data-driven.

- question: Do I need to be an expert in genomics or drug discovery to participate?
  answer: No, we welcome participants with diverse skill sets. Whether you're a bioinformatician, data scientist, software developer, UX designer, or a life sciences researcher, your expertise can contribute to innovative solutions. Teams typically benefit from a mix of technical and domain knowledge.

- question: What kind of projects can I work on?
  answer: Projects should utilize Open Targets data or API in some way. They can focus on areas like data integration, visualization tools, machine learning applications, or clinical use cases. You can bring your own idea or join an existing team. The only requirements are that projects must be open-source and related to target validation or drug discovery.

- question: How do teams get formed?
  answer: Teams will be formed on the first day of the hackathon after project pitches. You can come with a pre-formed team (2-5 people) or join one during the event. We encourage diverse teams with complementary skills. If you have a project idea, you'll have the opportunity to pitch it and recruit team members.

- question: Can I participate if I can't attend in person?
  answer: Absolutely! We're offering a full virtual participation track. Virtual participants will have access to livestreamed sessions, team collaboration tools, mentorship, and equal consideration for awards. We've designed the hackathon to ensure remote participants can meaningfully contribute to teams.

- question: What should I prepare before the hackathon?
  answer: Familiarize yourself with the Open Targets Platform (platform.opentargets.org) and API (docs.targetvalidation.org). Come with your laptop and any development environments you typically use. If you have a project idea, prepare a brief (1-minute) pitch. We also recommend joining our pre-hackathon orientation webinar for further preparation tips.

- question: Is there any funding or are there prizes for the winning projects?
  answer: Yes, we will offer prizes for different categories like "Most Innovative," "Best Technical Implementation," and "Highest Potential Impact." Winners will also have opportunities to present their work at future Open Targets events and potential support for continued project development. Details about specific prizes will be announced closer to the event.

- question: Can I use external datasets or tools in my project?
  answer: Yes, you can use external datasets or tools as long as they're publicly available and you adhere to their respective licenses. Your project should still utilize Open Targets data or API in some meaningful way. If you plan to use proprietary data, please contact us before the event to discuss potential limitations.

- question: What happens to the projects after the hackathon?
  answer: All projects will be hosted on GitHub under the Open Targets organization with the appropriate open-source licenses. Projects with significant potential may receive further development support from Open Targets. We encourage continued collaboration after the event and will facilitate connections between participants and interested stakeholders.

- question: How accessible is the venue for the in-person event?
  answer: The Wellcome Genome Campus is fully accessible to people with disabilities. If you have specific accommodation needs, please indicate them during registration and we'll work to ensure your comfortable participation. For detailed accessibility information about the venue, please contact us directly.
