    Mathew leads the Translational Cancer Genomics laboratory and Genomics of 
    Drug Sensitivity in Cancer Project at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. 
    Mathew's team uses high-throughput drug sensitivity screens and genome-editing 
    technology in cancer and normal human cells to understand how cancer genes 
    contribute to disease and to facilitate the development of new treatments. 
    After obtaining a BSc in Biochemistry (Hons.) at the University of British 
    Columbia, Canada, Mathew completed his PhD with Prof. Richard Marais at the 
    Institute of Cancer Research (London, UK) on the characterisation of BRAF 
    as a cancer gene. In 2005 Mathew moved to the laboratory of Prof. Ashok 
    Venkitaraman (Cambridge, UK) for his post-doctoral research, where he 
    discovered a new regulator of cell division. Mathew joined the Wellcome 
    Sanger Institute in 2009.

    Moritz leads a research group at EMBL-EBI investigating the underlying mechanisms of 
    cancer development and seeking to understand the differences in therapy success and 
    outcomes in different individuals. His team develops statistical models for relating 
    different layers of genomic, molecular and clinical data to establish connections 
    between genotype and phenotype, and tools to predict outcomes based on comprehensive, 
    high-dimensional datasets. The group also explores the evolutionary dynamics of cancer. 
    He has a PhD in Computational Biology from ETH Zurich (2012), and carried out 
    postdoctoral work at the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (2012-2015). Moritz joined 
    EMBL-EBI as a Research group leader in August 2015.

    Jack Pollard is Director of Translational and Experimental Medicine, Bioinformatics at 
    Sanofi since 2013. He is a leader at identifying both (1) novel relevant disease 
    targets/signatures and (2) compounds with novel mechanisms of action by applying and 
    developing statistical and computational methods. He also is an innovator at generating 
    testable hypotheses about target/compound mechanisms and/or biomarkers via computational 
    and pathway modeling systems. Jack Pollard started his career at Sanofi in 2005 as Principal 
    Research Investigator, Bioinformatics. In 2007, he took a role as Senior Manager and later 
    became Associate Director, Oncology Translational and Experimental Medicine, Bioinformatics, 
    before taking over his current position. Prior to joining Sanofi he was Director of
