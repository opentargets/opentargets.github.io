The position is based in the Garnett lab, world-leaders in functional genomics, in collaboration with the Petsalaki group at EMBL-EBI. Drug combination therapies for cancer can provide new treatments for patients and combat drug resistance. You will join a multidisciplinary team performing large-scale two-gene CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens in cancer cell lines to systematically identify and validate target combinations.

Substantial CRISPR-Cas9 screening datasets have been generated and initial computational pipelines established. You will support the analysis and interpretation of these unique data, as well as lead the mechanistic validation of candidate target combinations. Specifically, this includes applying cancer therapeutics knowledge to guide the analysis and interpretation of large-scale screening datasets to gain novel insights.  Additionally, you will use a range of cutting-edge cellular and molecular biology techniques to validate target combinations emerging from these analyses.
