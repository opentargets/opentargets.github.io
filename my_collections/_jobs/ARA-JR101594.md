We are seeking an Advanced Research Assistant on a 12 month Contract to join a multidisciplinary project applying single cell genomics to cells isolated from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or healthy control patients.

The goal of the project is to identify genetic variants that are associated with gene expression in intestinal cells, and then combine these with data from genetic studies of IBD patients to identify potential novel drug targets for IBD. This is a laboratory-based role where you will assist with processing of project samples, tracking of experimental data and development of new laboratory protocols. You will be part of an active interdisciplinary team of laboratory and computational scientists and be expected to advise and support the computational researchers regarding experimental processes.
