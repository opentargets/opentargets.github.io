We are seeking an enthusiastic and motivated Technical Specialist (Senior Research Assistant) with immunology expertise to provide experimental, scientific and operational support to the Open Targets Validation Lab at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. Within the Open Targets Consortium, we run a number of projects focusing on diseases with inflammatory component. 
These projects generate lists of targets with new therapeutic potential, and the mission of the Validation Lab is to provide additional experimental evidence in support of the relevance of these targets in disease biology.
