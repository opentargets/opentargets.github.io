We are looking for a Web Developer to join Open Targets at EMBL-EBI. As a key member of the Open Targets core team, you will design and build cloud-first software tailored for the interface between large-scale biomedical data and drug discovery. 

In collaboration with the other Open Targets partners (BMS, Genentech, GSK, Pfizer, Sanofi, and the Wellcome Sanger Institute), you will work on developing and maintaining our two flagship open-source applications â€” the Open Targets Platform and Open Targets Genetics. Together, these two resources integrate, organise, and present vast amounts of biomedical data to help research scientists identify and prioritise potential therapeutic drug targets.
