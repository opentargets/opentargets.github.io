Open Targets has launched Open Targets Genetics (https://genetics.opentargets.org), a portal that aggregates large scale GWAS data with functional genomics data to identify potential drug targets at disease and trait-associated loci.

An exciting Senior Computational Biologist / Computational Biologist (dependent upon experience) role funded by Open Targets has become available at the Wellcome Sanger Institute under the direction of Dr. Maya Ghoussaini. This is a unique opportunity for you to work with cutting-edge human genetics and functional genomics datasets and analyses and participate in the enhancement of the Open Targets Genetics Portal through the development of new functionality and features.
