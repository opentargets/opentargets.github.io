Open Targets has launched Open Targets Genetics (https://genetics.opentargets.org), a portal that aggregates large scale GWAS data with functional genomics data to identify potential drug targets at disease and trait-associated loci.

An exciting Senior Computational Biologist / Computational Biologist (dependent upon experience) role funded by Open Targets has become available at the Wellcome Sanger Institute under the direction of Dr. Maya Ghoussaini. This is a unique opportunity for you to work with cutting-edge human genetics and functional genomics datasets and analyses and participate in the enhancement of the Open Targets Genetics Portal through the development of new functionality and features.

As a Senior Computational Biologist will be responsible for overseeing computational support to all projects and helping with data analysis. You will also develop and apply a range of computational tools to large datasets of genetics and genomics, write manuscripts for publication and keep track of developed codes and generated data within the group.

As a Computational Biologist you will help develop and apply computational pipelines to identify and prioritise drug targets.

This is an opportunity to work across a range of analyses including:

Rare and expert-curated loss-of-function (LoF) variants from consanguienous population
Mendelian Randomisation results, single cell QTLs, tissue enrichment
Machine Learning approaches
You will  have the opportunity to work at the interface between academia and industry through regular interactions with Open Targets pharma partners and active computational and experimental research teams across the Sanger Institute and EBI. You will work closely with members of the Open Targets Core Platform Team and Genetics Team as well as with our national and international collaborators. You will be supported in your personal and professional development and have the opportunity to conduct peer-reviewed publications around using genetics and genomics approaches to guide drug discovery and present them at national and international conferences.
