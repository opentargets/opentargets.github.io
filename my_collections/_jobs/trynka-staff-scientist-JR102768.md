Leverage CRISPR technologies to uncover how disease-associated genes regulate immune cell function. This role is for a 12 month fixed term contract.

You will coordinate and support the development and execution of experimental workflows of a collaborative project which aims to use CRISPR tools to link gene perturbations through transcriptional programmes to cell functions in primary immune cells, working closely with experts from academia and industry. Specifically, your focus will be in setting up CRISPR knock-out and activation protocols for perturbing CD8+ T cells and supporting parallel work in CD4+ cells.

IMMERSE brings together expertise from Open Targets industry partners and four research groups (Trynka, Vento, Speak, and Soskic) each focused on an immune cell type, with an ambitious goal to uncover transcriptional programmes underpinning key immune cell functions. For this, we are generating large-scale transcriptional profiles for hundreds of gene perturbations to ultimately uncover disease biology and inform drug target discovery. Specifically, in our group we focus on the T cell arm.
