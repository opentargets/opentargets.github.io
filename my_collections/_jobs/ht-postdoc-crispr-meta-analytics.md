Play a key role in the OT Perturbation Catalogue Project, as an integral part of the team closely interacting with the other participating groups and the Open Targets consortium. You will extend existing algorithms and tools, and design and implement novel methods to support data analysis, curation, interpretation, and exploitation for target discovery and prioritisation.
