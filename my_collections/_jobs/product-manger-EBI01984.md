We are looking for a Product Manager to join <a href="/platform">Open Targets</a> at EMBL-EBI. We are open to applicants at different career stages, 
but we are keen to find someone that thrives in the product space where organisational strategy, technology, and user experience intersect.  

As a key member of the Open Targets Core team, you will be responsible for leading the product strategy of current 
and future informatics tools designed to support the identification and prioritisation of drug targets. Working in close 
collaboration with the Platform Coordinator, you will act as the advocate for Platform users and help set the vision and 
priorities for the cross-functional team that is responsible for ongoing product delivery. 
This will include building quarterly product roadmaps, defining key features, collaborating with data and technical teams on implementation, 
and facilitating dialogue between product teams and end users. Leveraging the expertise of our product owners and industry stakeholders, 
you will work in a dynamic, multidisciplinary, international environment to build products that help researchers tackle complex challenges in drug discovery and informatics.
