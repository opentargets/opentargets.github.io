We are seeking two enthusiastic and motivated postdocs to join an interdisciplinary team on an exciting new project using cutting-edge techniques to study how genes associated with immune diseases modulate immune cell functions. We will perform pooled CRISPR screens in CD4 T and  CD8 T cells to  assess the effects of gene perturbations on disease relevant phenotypes. 
The most interesting hits will be validation of using high throughput image-based cellular assays coupled with transcriptional readouts.
