Lead a major Open Targets collaborative project aimed at developing gene screening platforms for macrophages and dendritic cells. You will be based in the Vento-Tormo Lab in the Wellcome Sanger Institute's Cellular Genetics Programme.

The project uses CRISPR/Cas9 technology and will develop innovative methods for detailed screening and analysis of gene perturbations in these cells, employing single-cell genomics and functional analyses as key tools. The primary goal is to decode the gene regulatory networks that govern the functions of specific genes in macrophages and dendritic cells. Such insights are crucial for identifying targets in the drug development processes and paving the way for novel myeloid cell-based therapeutic approaches.
