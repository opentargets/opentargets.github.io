The OT Perturbation Catalogue project focuses on the creation of an online repository of data from functional genetics screens and, more generally, post-perturbational experiments (typically CRISPR screens with viability or transcriptomics readouts). We will focus on a specific meta-analytics work package of the OT Perturbation Catalogue project, developing computational methods for the reproducibility assessment1, harmonisation2 and analysis of inter-study CRISPR datasets, aggregating data and developing and using innovative AI based-methods for therapeutic target prioritisation pipelines3 on the resulting aggregated data for cancer4, neurodegenerative disorders and other diseases.

We are actively seeking a post-doctoral fellow to play a key role in the OT Perturbation Catalogue Project. The selected candidate will be an integral part of the team closely interacting with the other participating groups and the Open Targets consortium. They will extend existing algorithms and tools, and design and implement novel methods to support data analysis, curation, interpretation, and exploitation for target discovery and prioritisation.
