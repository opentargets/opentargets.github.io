You will perform targeted combinatorial CRISPR-screens with a set of identified top candidate genes associated with neurodegenerative disease such as Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s disease and build custom CRISPR libraries to knock out these genes and their combinations. You will use established differentiation protocols to generate neurons, astrocytes, and microglia and their cocultures and perform single-cell ‘omics and cellular phenotypic assays such as endo-lysosomal function, ER stress or cell painting on the resulting cells. 

The position will be based between the wet lab group of Dr Andrew Bassett and Dr Sarah Cooper and contribute to a collaborative project with the Lotfollahi Lab, working closely with Dr Mo Lotfollahi. 

Our aim is to identify and prioritise genes important for disease-relevant processes across multiple cell types, to reveal the underlying molecular mechanisms and new routes for therapeutic intervention. These datasets will be fed to generative AI methods to predict unmeasured perturbations, and an important aspect of this project will be the validation of these predicted perturbations in the lab. As part of this position, we will support you to develop your computational skills and learn concepts about machine learning.
