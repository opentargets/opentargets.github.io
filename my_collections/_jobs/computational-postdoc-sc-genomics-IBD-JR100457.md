We are looking for a Computational Postdoctoral Fellow (PDF) to be responsible for the analysis of our large-scale single-cell genomics studies of inflammatory bowel disease. It is a 3-year fixed term fellowship within the Genomics of Inflammation and Immunity group at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, headed by Dr. Carl Anderson. 

You will lead the analysis of a large single-cell genomics study aimed at elucidating the cellular and molecular mechanisms underpinning IBD susceptibility. We are generating single-cell RNA and/or ATAC sequencing data from gut biopsies and blood samples ascertained from hundreds of IBD patients and non-IBD controls. Data is already available for around 200 individuals, with more being generated over the next four years. You will use these data to identify genes, pathways and cell-types associated with IBD susceptibility, progression and drug response.
