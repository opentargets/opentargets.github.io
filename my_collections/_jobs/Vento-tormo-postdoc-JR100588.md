We have an exciting opportunity for a Postdoctoral Fellow to join Vento-Tormo Lab in our Cellular Genetics Programme for a 3 year contract to focus on  engineering human macrophages and dendritic cells to unlock their gene regulatory networks.

In this position, you will lead a major collaborative project aimed at developing gene screening platforms for macrophages and dendritic cells. The project involves using the established CRISPR/Cas9 technology and developing innovative methods for detailed screening and analysis of gene perturbations in these cells, employing single-cell genomics and functional analyses as key tools.
