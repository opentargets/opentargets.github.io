We are looking for a Web Developer to join Open Targets at EMBL-EBI. We are open to applicants at different career stages, but we are keen to find someone who wants to embrace cutting-edge technologies in order to tackle complex challenges in drug discovery and informatics.

As a key member of the <a href="/platform">Open Targets Core team</a>, you will design and build cloud-first software tailored for the interface between large-scale biomedical data and drug discovery. In collaboration with the other Open Targets partners (BMS, GSK, Sanofi, and the Wellcome Sanger Institute), you will work on developing and maintaining our two flagship open-source applications - the Open Targets Platform and the Open Targets Genetics Portal. Together, these two resources integrate, organise, and present vast amounts of biomedical data to help research scientists identify and prioritise potential therapeutic drug targets.
