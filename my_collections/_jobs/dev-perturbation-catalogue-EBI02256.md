This is an exciting opportunity to make a significant contribution to development of a new open-source Perturbation Catalogue for harmonised and curated human gene (e.g. CRISPR), variant (e.g. MAVE), and expression (e.g. Perturb-seq) data. 

You will be responsible for support and development of software to handle programmatic access and a portal interface to explore, combine, visualise and access a wealth of perturbation data. This will enable the extension and application of existing algorithms and the design of new computational methods for functional genetics and target identification and prioritisation, offering enhanced statistical power and the capability to work with disease subtypes at a finer granularity.
