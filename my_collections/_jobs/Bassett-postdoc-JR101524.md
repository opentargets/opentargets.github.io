Join an interdisciplinary team to help complete an exciting and ambitious project using cutting-edge techniques to study how genes associated with neurodegeneration contribute to disease in a cell-type-specific manner. We are performing targeted CRISPR screens in multiple disease-relevant cell populations derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) and assessing the resulting phenotypes using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and high throughput cellular assays.

The position will be based at Wellcome Sanger Institute under the leadership of Dr Andrew Bassett and Dr Sarah Cooper in collaboration with Dr Leopold Parts and Dr Florian Merkle. This project forms part of the Open Targets collaboration between academic and industrial partners to identify new drug targets for the treatment of neurodegenerative disease.
