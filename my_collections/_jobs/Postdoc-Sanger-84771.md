Are you looking for an opportunity to help build understanding and advance research of immune diseases?

We are seeking three highly committed postdoctoral fellows (PDFs) to join an interdisciplinary team on an exciting and ambitious new project using cutting-edge techniques to study how genes associated with immune diseases modulate broad and specific immune cell functions. We will perform targeted CRISPR screens independently in three human immune cell types (CD4 T cells, CD8 T cells, and B cells) and assess the effects of gene perturbations on cell phenotypes using high throughput image-based cellular assays coupled with transcriptional readouts. The positions will be based at Wellcome Sanger Institute under the supervision of Dr. Gosia Trynka, and in tight collaboration with Dr. Annie Speak at the University of Cambridge, Prof. David Sansom at the University College London, Dr. Blagoje Soskic at Human Technopole, as well as with Dr. Omer Bayraktar, Dr. Andrew Bassett and Dr. Panos Zalmas at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. This project forms part of the Open Targets (https://www.opentargets.org/) collaboration between academic and industrial partners to identify new drug targets for the treatment of immune diseases.
