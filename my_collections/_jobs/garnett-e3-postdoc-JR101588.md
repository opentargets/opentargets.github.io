Based in the laboratory of Dr. Mathew Garnett, join a multidisciplinary team from academia and industry to collaboratively generate and interpret large-scale proteomic datasets to map E3 target genes.

The position is at the cutting edge of systems biology through combining CRISPR-based genetic screening to systematically assemble proteomic maps of E3 ligase substrates in cancer cells, and will help provide insights into the cellular processes regulating protein degradation in cancer cells with the aim of advancing new therapies modulating protein degradation to selectively target cancer cells.
