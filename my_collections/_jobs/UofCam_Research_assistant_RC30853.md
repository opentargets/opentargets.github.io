We are seeking an eager research assistant to join Dr Annie Speak's group, based within the new Cambridge Institute for Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Disease (CITIID) housed on the Cambridge Biomedical Campus. The group studies the interaction between the immune system and tumours with a long-term view to manipulate this in order to development new therapies.

This position will support the experimental aspects of a new project investigating the role of Natural Killer cells within cancer. This will be achieved through manipulating Natural Killer cells to discover intrinsic gene function and utilising co-culture models with cancer cells to uncover cancer cell intrinsic pathways that can result in evasion or sensitisation to cytotoxicity.
