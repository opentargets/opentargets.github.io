We are seeking an eager research assistant to join Dr Annie Speak's group, based within the new Cambridge Institute for Therapeutic Immunology and Infectious Disease (CITIID) housed on the Cambridge Biomedical Campus. The group studies the interaction between the immune system and tumours with a long-term view to manipulate this in order to development new therapies.
