Lead a research project building upon innovative AI approaches to define gene x drug exposure x phenotype relationships at scale over continuous time in large human cohorts. We are looking for a highly motivated bioinformatics expert or data scientist to join this exciting project, and to drive specific aspects of this cutting-edge research, including the analysis of population scale genetic cohorts with electronic healthcare and prescriptions records. You will be based in the Birney research and Open Targets groups at EMBL-EBI and work closely with the Gerstung group at DKFZ.
