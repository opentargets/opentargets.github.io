We have an opportunity for an Advanced Research Assistant for a 3 year fixed term position.

You will support the development of experimental workflows of a largely collaborative project funded by Open Targets, which aims to use CRISPR tools to link gene perturbations through transcriptional programmes to cell functions in primary immune cells. We are interested to map how up- and down-regulation of gene activity affects function of different immune cells.
