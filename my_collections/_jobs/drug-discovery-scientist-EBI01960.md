We are looking for an enthusiastic and talented scientist with experience in drug target discovery and an interest in the mechanisms underlying human disease 
to join the <a href="/platform">Open Targets</a> team.

The postholderâ€™s primary tasks will be to generate novel therapeutic target hypotheses and develop highly annotated, prioritised drug target lists. 
You will have access to the wealth of data that Open Targets has integrated from the public domain, our informatics tools and our pre-publication experimental 
data from systematic genetics and functional genomics projects. You will use your molecular and cell and/or computational biology background and an understanding 
of the mechanisms underlying human disease in collaboration with Open Targets project teams and Drug Discovery scientists in our industry partners to build best 
practice approaches for different therapy areas. The postholder will join a fast-paced, startup-like environment, and will work closely with a bioinformatician and 
the Open Targets Core Platform team to realise our vision of an integrated drug Target Engine.
