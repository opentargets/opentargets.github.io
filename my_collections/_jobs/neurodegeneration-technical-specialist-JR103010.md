Join the Bayraktar lab at the Wellcome Sanger Institute to generate large-scale spatial transcriptomic datasets of neurodegenerative diseases.

You will join a new project to create comparative cell atlases of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). You will work with a close group of wet and dry lab collaborators to generate Xenium spatial transcriptomics datasets from brain tissue over 200 patients. Your role will initially focus on tissue handling and optimisation of spatial data generation, including a combination of Xenium with high multiplexed protein imaging. The role will subsequently expand to supervise and coordinate single cell and spatial transcriptomic data generation in the project, with support from your line manager.
