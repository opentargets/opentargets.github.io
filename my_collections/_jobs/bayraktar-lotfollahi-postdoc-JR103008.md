Join the Bayraktar and Lotfollahi labs at the Wellcome Sanger Institute to apply cutting edge machine learning models to large-scale single cell and spatial transcriptomics datasets of neurodegenerative diseases. Supported by Open Targets, you will have access to novel cell atlassing datasets of patient tissue samples and close collaborators in biology and machine learning. This position is for a 3 year contract.

You will join a new project to create comparative cell atlases of Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). You will work with a close group of wet and dry lab collaborators to analyse single nuclei and  Xenium spatial transcriptomics datasets from brain tissue over 200 patients. You will use state-of-the-art machine learning models to integrate multi-modal data, identify disease vulnerable cell types and pathological cell interactions, with a focus on spatial data analysis.
