We are looking for an enthusiastic and talented Bioinformatician to join the <a href="/platform">Open Targets</a> team. 


The postholderâ€™s primary tasks will be the active development of pipelines that integrate our growing experimental data with public domain data and prioritisation 
information to provide best in class target lists. This will require benchmarking against appropriate metrics and development of processes to migrate these pipelines 
into dashboard type tools within the Open Targets software ecosystem. The postholder will join a fast-paced, startup-like environment, and will interact with data generator teams, 
data analysts, data managers and drug discovery scientists to realise optimal target selection to advance drug discovery.
