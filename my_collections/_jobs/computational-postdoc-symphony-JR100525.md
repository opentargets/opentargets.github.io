We are looking for a Computational Postdoctoral Fellow to help deliver Project Symphony, an OpenTargets-funded Project aiming to perform extensive combinatorial CRISPR screening of cancer cell lines at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. This position will be for a 3-year fixed term contract. You will join the  Experimental Cancer Genetics Team lead by David Adams.

In this project, we will use a combination of both established CRISPR/Cas9 technology and new CRISPR technologies with the aim of identifying genetic interactions and gaining mechanistic insights into the cellular effects of gene co-disruption.
