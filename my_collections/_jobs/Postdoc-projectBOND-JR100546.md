Targeted protein degradation is a promising area for development of innovative therapeutics. Working with Mathew Garnett, the position is at the cutting-edge of systems biology through combining CRISPR-based genetic screening to systematically assemble proteomic maps of E3 ligase substrates in cancer cells.  You will work as part of multidisciplinary team from academia and industry to collaboratively generate and interpret large-scale proteomic datasets to map E3 target genes.
