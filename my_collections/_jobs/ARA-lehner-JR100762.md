We have an exciting opportunity for an Advanced Research Assistant to join the Lehner group for a 3 year fixed term contract to work on an Open Targets Project.
The Lehner lab is focused on combining massively parallel genetic perturbation experiments with modelling and machine learning to understand, predict and engineer how changes in DNA sequence alter the activities, interactions and regulation of proteins and RNAs. The goal is both to generate reference atlases and predictive models of variant effects to guide clinical genetics and datasets of sufficient scale and diversity to directly tackle the fundamental sequence-to-activity encoding problems of molecular biology using artificial intelligence and modelling.
