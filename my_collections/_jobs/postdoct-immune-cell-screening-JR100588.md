We have an exciting opportunity for a Postdoctoral Fellow to join Vento-Tormo Lab in our Cellular Genetics Programme for a 3 year contract.
As part of Open Targets you will be working with other academic and industrial partners to develop immune cell screening platforms in order to target a large number of genes. We will use established CRISPR/Cas9 technology, but also develop new strategies to screen and multimodally assess gene perturbations in in vitro-derived immune cells. With this comprehensive approach, we will gain insight into the effects that gene perturbations have on transcriptional effects and their role in gene regulatory networks in the setting of different immune cell populations. This will inform target prioritisation in drug development processes.
