We are looking for an enthusiastic and talented machine learning data scientist to join the AI knowledge management project. This position will be situated in the Literature Services team, which manages Europe PMC. 

We are interested in applications of machine learning to mine the research literature for additional types of entities relevant to drug discovery not already available to Open Targets (such as variants, biomarkers, tissues/cell types, adverse events, and assay conditions). This position provides a real opportunity to make a significant impact on a critical problem in drug discovery for the many users of the OT Platform and an opportunity to contribute to the open source models and code associated with biological entities.
