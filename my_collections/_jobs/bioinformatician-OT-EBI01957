We are looking for an enthusiastic and talented Bioinformatician to join the Open Targets team. 
The postholderâ€™s primary tasks will be the active development of pipelines that integrate our growing experimental data with
public domain data and prioritisation information to provide best in class target lists. This will require benchmarking against appropriate metrics and development 
of processes to migrate these pipelines into dashboard type tools within the Open Targets software ecosystem.
