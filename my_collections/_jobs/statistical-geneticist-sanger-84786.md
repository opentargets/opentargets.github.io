Open Targets has launched Open Targets Genetics (https://genetics.opentargets.org), a portal that aggregates large scale GWAS data with functional genomics data to identify potential drug targets at disease and trait-associated loci.

An exciting Senior Statistical Geneticist/ Statistical Geneticist (dependent upon experience) role funded by Open Targets has become available at the Wellcome Sanger Institute under the direction of Dr. Maya Ghoussaini. This is a unique opportunity for you to work with cutting-edge human genetics and genomics datasets and analyses and participate in the enhancement of the Open Targets Genetics Portal through the development of new functionality and features.

As a Statistical Geneticist will engage in the integration of new GWAS data and conduct downstream analyses using LD reference panels, evaluate gene-level variant aggregation criteria and integrate rare and common genetic evidence for a given disease-target pair.

On top of this, as a Senior Statistical Geneticist will think about key biological questions and visualisations to help answer them in Open Targets Genetics. You will develop your own statistical methods and work closely with members of Open Targets Genetics and Platform and other teams at EMBL/EBI, Sanger, and pharma partners. You will develop a range of data analysis tools to large genetics and genomic datasets, write manuscripts for publication and keep track of developed codes and generated data.
