The <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/group/garnett-group/" target="_blank">Garnett lab at the Wellcome Sanger Institute</a> are seeking a Senior Bioinformatician to play a pivotal role in the development of innovative cancer drug combinations therapies.

Many cancer patients have tumours which are resistant to existing treatments. Combination therapies aimed at inhibiting multiple targets can provide new treatments for patients and combat drug resistance. In this role, you will join a multidisciplinary team focused on identifying and validating targets for combination drug therapies.  The role includes curating, analysing and modelling datasets to generate insights from complex and large-scale multi-dimensional functional and genomic datasets.  You will work in team environment with cell biologists, biochemists, and other data scientists to deliver high value targets for drug development. This an opportunity to develop transformative medicines for cancer patients at the interface of academic research and industry.

The Translational Cancer Genomics team, led by Dr. Mathew Garnett, investigates how genetic alterations in cancer contribute to disease and impact on response to therapy. Our research integrates cancer genomics, cell biology and cancer therapeutics and employs cutting-edge experimental and data science approaches to tackle some of the biggest challenges in cancer.
