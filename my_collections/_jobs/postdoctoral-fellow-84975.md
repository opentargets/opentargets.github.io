Applications are invited for a 3-year Postdoctoral Fellowship within the Genomics of Inflammation and Immunity group at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI), headed by Dr. Carl Anderson. We are a multidisciplinary team consisting of statistical geneticists, molecular biologists, bioinformaticians, computer scientists and clinicians. We generate large-scale genetic and genomic datasets to understand the biological basis of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The translational aims of our research are to identify novel candidate drug targets and catalyse personalised medicine for IBD. There is a strong emphasis on personal development and career progression within the team.
