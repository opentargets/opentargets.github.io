Develop a comprehensive open source side effect resource for the scientific and pharmaceutical community, and provide structured and standardised training sets for AI/ML applications to improve early identification of safety liabilities.      

You will harness modern Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to extract data from a range of relevant resources, such as clinical trials, publications and drug labels. You will work closely with team members to ensure development of automated pipelines and effective integration into the ChEMBL database and Open Targets Platform, to assist users in the selection of safe and efficacious drug targets.
