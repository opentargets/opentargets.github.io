Develop and apply integrative computational pipelines to dissect immune-cell phenotypes and cell–cell interactions across Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, and Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patient tissues and matched induced pluripotent stem cells models.

As part of this role, you will analyze large-scale single-cell and spatial transcriptomics datasets from human brain samples to identify shared multi-cellular pathological features, build and apply statistical and machine-learning methods to infer cell-cell signaling networks and causal drivers, develop pipelines to compare patient-derived data with hiPSC-derived models, identifying recapitulated phenotypes and candidate intervention targets, and supervise junior team members.
