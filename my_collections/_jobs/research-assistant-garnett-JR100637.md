We have an exciting opportunity for two Research Assistants to join Screening Team within the Garnett Laboratory in our Cancer, Ageing and Somatic Mutation Programme for 2 year contracts.
This laboratory based role provides an exciting opportunity to work with cancer cell models including organoids and a collection of over 1000 cell lines. You will prepare and process microwell assay plates for high-throughput drug sensitivity screening, perform CRISPR-Cas9 screens and provide general support for the laboratory. In addition, you will be preparing reagents and maintaining consumable stocks for both screening pipelines and maintaining an effective and safe laboratory area.
