We are looking for a Postdoctoral Fellow (PDF) to help deliver Project Symphony, an OpenTargets funded Project aiming to perform extensive combinatorial CRISPR screening of cancer cell lines at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. You will work closely with Dr. Kostas Tzelepis who is based at the University of Cambridge and an expert in CRISPR systems.  This will be for a 3 year fixed term contract.
