Join a new international collaborative Open Targets project between the University of Oxford (Simon Buczacki), University of Copenhagen (Ana Cvejic) and the Wellcome Sanger Institute (Peter Campbell). This translational project seeks to explore the response of rectal cancer to chemo-radiation with a particular focus on tumour immunity. You will work within the Tumour Evolution and Cell Identity (Buczacki) Laboratory, and have patient-facing interactions (such as consent and tissue acquisition) in the John Radcliffe Hospital and Churchill Hospital (Oxford University Hospitals NHS Trust).
