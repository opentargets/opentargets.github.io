We are looking for an experienced Senior Staff Scientist to help deliver Project Symphony, an OpenTargets funded Project aiming to perform extensive combinatorial CRISPR screening of cancer cell lines at the Wellcome Sanger Institute.  You will be joining the Experimental Cancer Genetics Group for a 3 year fixed term contract. In this project, we will use a combination of both established CRISPR/Cas9 technology and new CRISPR technologies with the aim of identifying genetic interactions and gaining mechanistic insights into the cellular effects of gene co-disruption.
