We are looking for a computational analyst/biologist with strong background in single cell genomics to join the Open Targets team. We are seeking an enthusiastic team member to expand our informatics platforms through integration of single cell omics data to enhance drug discovery. In this Single Cell Computational Biologist role you will actively develop pipelines that integrate our growing experimental single-cell data (including RNA expression, protein expression, single-cell eQTLs) with public domain data.
