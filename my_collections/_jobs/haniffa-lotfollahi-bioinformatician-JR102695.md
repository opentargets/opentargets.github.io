As part of a collaborative Open Targets project, support single-cell and spatial transcriptomic studies needed to train large-scale AI-based foundation models.

This role will aid multiple computational projects across the lab, focusing on curating large-scale cohorts of training data to train foundation models. This is an exciting opportunity to work in single-cell and spatial genomics to understand how the immune system develops and maintains health.

You will maintain a key understanding of the research portfolio within the team and contribute to the development of innovative and creative data analysis strategies. You will also contribute to the development of the training pipeline and machine learning and artificial intelligence models. Additionally, you will have the opportunity to develop your skills in machine learning and AI models. Finally, you will be responsible for exploring opportunities to transition project-based analysis work into established scalable pipelines and advocate for open and reproducible science.
