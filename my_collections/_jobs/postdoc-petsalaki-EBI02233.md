The Petsalaki group uses network analysis, data integration and machine learning to study human cell signalling. For this Open Targets project, the group is collaborating with the Garnett group (Sanger institute) to discover combination targets for two types of cancer with unmet need.

We have already finished collecting the largest dual CRISPR guide dataset to date comprising 65,000 gene pairs across two tissue types and approximately 50 cell lines, and are now looking to understand principles underpinning successful combination gene pairs in cancer and to discover actionable gene pairs that could have an impact in the clinic. 

In this role, you will integrate this unique and exciting data with other omics datasets, performing systems level and network-based analyses to interpret and extract value from the data. You will also be developing an AI-based method (e.g. through graph neural networks) to leverage our unique dataset for the prediction of combination targets beyond the ones measured in our experiments.
