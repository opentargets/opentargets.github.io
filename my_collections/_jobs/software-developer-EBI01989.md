We are looking for an enthusiastic and driven backend software developer to join Open Targets at EMBL-EBI. We are open to applicants at different career stages, 
but we are keen to find someone who wants to embrace cutting-edge technologies in order to tackle complex challenges in drug discovery and informatics.
As a key member of the Open Targets Core team, you will help design, build and operate cloud-first software tailored for the interface between large-scale biomedical data and drug discovery.
