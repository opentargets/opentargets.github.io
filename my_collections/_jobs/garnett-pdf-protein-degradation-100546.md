We have an exciting opportunity for a Postdoctoral Fellow to join our Cancer, Ageing and Somatic Mutation Programme for a 3 year fixed term contract. You will be based in the laboratory of Dr. Mathew Garnett.

Targeted protein degradation is a promising area for development of innovative therapeutics. E3 ubiquitin ligases are a family of proteins that conjugate ubiquitin to target proteins, resulting in an array of cellular responses, including protein degradation. You will be part of a multi-disciplinary project team aiming to systematically map and functionally validate E3-ligase substrates in cancer cells. This information will provide insights into the cellular processes regulating protein degradation in cancer cells and can be used to advance new therapies modulating protein degradation to selectively target cancer cells.
