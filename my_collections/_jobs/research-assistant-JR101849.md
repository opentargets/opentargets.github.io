A position is now available for a Research Assistant on a 1 year, fixed term contract to join the research group of Gosia Trynka in close collaboration with Andrew Bassett and Open Targets partners at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. This is a Computational Research Assistant role to contribute in the analysis of large single-cell RNAseq data from iPSC-derived microglia to advance drug discovery. The scientific objective of the project is to understand the genetic architecture of multiple neuroinflammatory cell traits in microglia. 

Applications will be reviewed on an ongoing basis so the role may close early if a successful candidate is appointed.
