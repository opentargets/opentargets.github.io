We are seeking an enthusiastic and motivated Postdoctoral Fellow with a strong immunology background to join our interdisciplinary team on an exciting project that will use cutting-edge techniques to study how genes associated with immune diseases modulate immune cell functions for a 2 year fixed term contract. 

Specifically, we aim to focus on B cell biology and using pooled CRISPR screens assess the effects of gene perturbations on disease relevant phenotypes. The strongest hits from the screens will be followed up using high throughput image-based cellular assays coupled with single-cell transcriptional readouts.
