We have an exciting opportunity for a Principal Bioinformatician to join Parts Group in our Human Genetics Programme for a 1 year fixed term contract.
You will be responsible for utilising and developing computational methods to find new drug targets for project focused on neurodegenerative disorders. The NeuroID project performs genetic perturbation of candidate genes followed by in-depth phenotyping; core aspects of the role are to provide computational and statistical input into target selection, analyses of assays (mainly CRISPR+scRNAseq), and follow-up analyses to link findings to other sources of external evidence.
