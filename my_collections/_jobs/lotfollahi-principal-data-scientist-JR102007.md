Principal Machine Learning Research Data Scientist. Within the AI/ML Faculty group led by Dr. Mohammad Lotfollahi, join a project that aims to leverage datasets internally generated at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and publicly available data from human cells to create foundational models for biology. This includes integrating and processing data from various sources to develop robust and versatile AI models. To achieve this, you will work with open-source software, proposing, developing, and maintaining new solutions to analyze and interpret large-scale single-cell datasets.
