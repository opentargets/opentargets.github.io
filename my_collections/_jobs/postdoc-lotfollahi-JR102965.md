Join the Lotfollahi Group, an interdisciplinary team of ML researchers, computational biologists, clinicians and experimentalists, for a 3 year postdoctoral Fellow contract. Our mission is to develop data-driven and biologically grounded AI tools for decoding complex cellular systems.

As part of an Open Targets project, you will apply foundational model development and cutting-edge data analysis to real-world problems in drug discovery and target identification. These projects are conducted in close collaboration with leading pharmaceutical companies, bridging academic research and practical industry applications. This is a unique chance to gain experience in translational bioinformatics, building tools and models directly relevant to therapeutic development.

We welcome applications from diverse technical and scientific backgrounds â€” from those interested in fundamental questions in biology and medicine, to those focused on ML/AI method development. We are particularly excited to work with individuals who are passionate about biology, foundation  model development, modeling cellular perturbation responses, predicting patient behaviors, and analyzing multi-modal biological data.
