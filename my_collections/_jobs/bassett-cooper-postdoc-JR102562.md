Join an interdisciplinary team to perform an exciting and ambitious project using cutting-edge techniques with the aim to understand commonalities and differences in immune responses across neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s Disease and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis). 

The position will be based at Wellcome Sanger Institute under the leadership of Dr Andrew Bassett and Dr Sarah Cooper and will also benefit from a secondment position working under the leadership of Dr Sally Cowley at the University of Oxford where they will spend the first half of their contract.

The successful applicant will establish complex disease-relevant cellular models derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). These will be modulated using external stressors and genetic backgrounds, and the resulting phenotypes will be analysed using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) and high-content imaging-based spatial assays that will allow comparison back to human patient samples to understand the disease-relevant phenotypes that can be modelled.
