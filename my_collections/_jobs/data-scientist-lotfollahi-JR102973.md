Deliver a project at the intersection of machine learning and biology, as part of a two year fixed term contract. The project aims to leverage internal datasets and publicly available data from human cells to create foundational models for cellular biology predicting cellular behaviours in response to different perturbations, to enhance our understanding of life's rules and improving health for all.

Your role will involve designing foundational models leveraging multi-modal readouts. This includes integrating and processing data from various sources to develop robust and versatile AI models. To achieve this, you will work with open-source software, proposing, developing, and maintaining new solutions to analyse and interpret large-scale single-cell datasets. We have access to unique data and are also in the position to generate data to train unique models. Additionally, we have substantial computational power and GPU resources to train large models efficiently.
