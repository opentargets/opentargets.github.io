We are looking for an enthusiastic and talented (NLP) data scientist to join the newly initiated AI knowledge management project, initially for a period of 3 years. 

This position will be situated in the Chemical Biology Services Team. We are in particular interested in applications of AI and machine learning to mine the research literature for additional types of entities relevant to drug discovery not currently available to Open Targets (such as variants, biomarkers, tissues/cell types, adverse events, and assay conditions).
