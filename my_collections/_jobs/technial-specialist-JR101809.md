We are seeking an enthusiastic and motivated scientist with expertise in experimental oncology to provide experimental, scientific and operational support to the Open Targets Validation Lab at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. We work with world-leading experts from both academia and industry to run discovery projects for targets of new therapeutic potential, and the mission of the Open Targets Validation Lab is to provide additional experimental evidence to support the relevance of these targets in disease biology. This position offers an exciting opportunity to work on a project that comprises the largest, to date, dataset of dual CRISPR perturbations (65K pairs, 45 cell lines, 2 tissue types) and validate therapeutic hypotheses that exploit synthetic lethality in cancer.
