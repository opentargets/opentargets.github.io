Join Open-IBD, a multidisciplinary project applying single cell genomics to cells isolated from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or healthy individuals, for a 2 year fixed term contract. Open-IBD aims to provide a deep muti-omic characterisation of early stage IBD in a large cohort of 1000 newly diagnosed patients to nominate causal factors driving IBD pathology and identify biomarkers of long- term outcomes in IBD, including disease progression and drug response.

This is a laboratory-based role in Carl Anderson's group. You will liaise with clinical teams around UK on the acquistion of human tissue/blood samples and assist with processing these for single cell omics assays. Training for SOPs will be provided but experience in handing human tissue and isolation of PBMCs and plasma from human blood samples, and experience in working with large scale data and maintain accurate records is necessary.
