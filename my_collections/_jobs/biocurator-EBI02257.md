Join the Human Genomics Team at the EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI), as part of the new open-source Perturbation Catalogue project for harmonised and curated human gene, variant, and expression data. This is an opportunity to rise to the challenges of ‘big data’ and make contributions that advance the reach and utility of sequence data.

The new resource will help to address a fundamental need in the scientific and drug discovery community for a comprehensive resource to understand the impact of modifying genes and proteins. You will be responsible for development and implementation of data standards, ontologies, and manual and automated curation protocols for the harmonisation and standardisation of a wealth of perturbation data, helping to address this fundamental need in the scientific community.
