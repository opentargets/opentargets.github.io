Play a key role in the Open Targets Perturbation Catalogue Project, which aims to create an online repository of data from functional genetics screens and, more generally, post-perturbational experiments (typically CRISPR screens with viability or transcriptomics readouts). We will focus on a specific meta-analytics work package, developing computational methods for the reproducibility assessment, harmonisation and analysis of inter-study CRISPR datasets, aggregating data and developing and using innovative AI based-methods for therapeutic target prioritisation pipelines3 on the resulting aggregated data for cancer, neurodegenerative disorders and other diseases.
