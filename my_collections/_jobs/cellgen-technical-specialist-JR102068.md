Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most common cancer worldwide, accounting for approximately 10% of cancer deaths. A new Open Targets project aims to examine the intricate interplay between immune cells, cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs), and malignant cells by applying single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics (STx), and WGS on samples from colorectal patients before and after treatment.

We are seeking an experienced Technical Specialist to join the project team on a 3 year, fixed term contract to primarily perform single-cell RNAseq techniques on patient samples. It is expected that you will also be able to use your skills and experience in support of faculty projects in the Cell Gen Research Programme.
