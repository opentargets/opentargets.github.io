Do you have expertise in human-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs), molecular biology, and, ideally, in vitro infection models?

Join the wet lab team of the Haniffa Lab (haniffalab.com), and contribute to a collaborative project with the Lotfollahi Lab (https://lotfollahi.com/). Your primary role will focus on optimizing protocols to introduce perturbations and evaluate their effects in a skin organoid model derived from hiPSCs. As part of this position, we will support the successful candidates to develop their computational skills and learn concepts about machine learning.
