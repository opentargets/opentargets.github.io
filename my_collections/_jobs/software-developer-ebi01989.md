We are looking for a backend software developer to join Open Targets at EMBL-EBI. We are open to applicants at different career stages, but we are keen to find someone who wants to embrace cutting-edge technologies in order to tackle complex challenges in drug discovery and informatics.

As a key member of the <a href="/platform">Open Targets Core team</a>, you will design, build and operate cloud-first software tailored for the interface between large-scale biomedical data and drug discovery. Together with the other Open Targets partners (BMS, GSK, Sanofi, and Wellcome Sanger Institute) you will contribute to the development of current and future informatics tools designed to support the identification and prioritisation of drug targets. Using cutting-edge technologies and leveraging the expertise of our product owners and industry stakeholders, you will work in a dynamic, multidisciplinary, international environment to tackle a wide range of algorithmic and technical challenges.
