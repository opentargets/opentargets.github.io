We are seeking a highly skilled and motivated Research Software Engineer with expertise in Python and Large Language Model (LLM) integration to join the AI knowledge management project for a period of 3 years. You will be a key player in designing and operating software that integrates cutting-edge knowledge graphs, LLMs and ML techniques into our biomedical data processing and drug discovery platforms.

This position would be embedded within the Saez-Rodriguez Group at the European Bioinformatics Institute and benefit from joint supervision with Sebastian Lobentanzer in at Heidelberg University Hospital (UKHD). You will work collaboratively across the project group with other experts in ML/AI, NLP, data integration and product delivery across ChEMBL, ePMC, Open Targets and Heidelberg University Hospital on a common goal to integrate cutting-edge technology for knowledge extraction, representation and integration to help drug discovery scientists to generate therapeutic hypotheses.
