This post is based at the University of Exeter.

Join a project to study immune response in neurodegenerative disease, as part of a large-scale collaborative research project involving, among others, the University of Exeter, Open Targets, the Wellcome Sanger Institute, EMBL-EBI, and the University of Oxford. The project aims to optimise and utilise cellular model systems, gene editing, and single-cell transcriptomic and spatial approaches to better understand immune responses in neurodegeneration.
