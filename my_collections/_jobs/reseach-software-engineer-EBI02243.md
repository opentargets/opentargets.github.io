Generative AI has revolutionised the way we interact with knowledge. We are extending the capabilities of the Open Targets Platform towards LLM integration using open-source frameworks. The project aims to improve on extraction, representation, and usage of scientific knowledge, and present this knowledge to platform users in a user-friendly way.

As a Research Software Engineer you will be instrumental in extending our Open Targets Platform framework to include a modular knowledge graph platform. Your expertise will enhance the robustness and efficiency of our data processing and knowledge representation systems, contributing directly to our open science initiatives.

This position would be embedded in the Saez-Rodriguez Group and benefit from joint supervision with Sebastian Lobentanzer at Heidelberg University Hospital (UKHD).
