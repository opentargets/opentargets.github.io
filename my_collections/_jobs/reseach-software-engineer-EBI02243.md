Generative AI has revolutionised the way we interact with knowledge. We are extending the capabilities of the Open Targets Platform towards LLM integration using open-source frameworks. The project aims to improve on extraction, representation, and usage of scientific knowledge, and present this knowledge to platform users in a user-friendly way.

This position would be embedded in the Saez-Rodriguez Group and benefit from joint supervision with Sebastian Lobentanzer at Heidelberg University Hospital (UKHD).
