Scientists at Open Targets create a molecular map of myeloid differentiation using over 470,000 human induced pluripotent stem cells, showing that the differentiated cells are able to acquire definitive tissue-resident identities.. This will be an important resource to explore myelopoiesis and new therapeutic opportunities.
