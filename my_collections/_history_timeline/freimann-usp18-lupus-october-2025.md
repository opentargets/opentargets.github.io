The largest trans-eQTL meta-analysis in a single cell type, an Open Targets team analysed 3,734 lymphoblastoid cell line samples across nine cohorts, identifying four robust loci. They found an interesting variant in the USP18 locus: a trans-eQTL that increases the expression of 50 interferon response genes. This variant also colocalises with a GWAS signal for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).
