human genetics with complementary data types to guide the discovery and development of 
novel therapies for immunological, cardiovascular, and fibrotic diseases. Prior to BMS, 
she worked at Merck & Co (MSD), where she used human genetics to identify novel drug 
targets and to support specific drug development programs. Emily received her MS in 
Applied Statistics and PhD in Human Genetics from Vanderbilt University in 2013. 
She then completed a postdoctoral fellowship in the Computational and Statistical 
Genomics Branch of the National Human Genome Research Institute at the National
