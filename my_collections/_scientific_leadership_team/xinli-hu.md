Xinli Hu is Director of Human Genetics in Pfizer’s Systems Immunology group. 

Her career in genomic sciences began at the Broad Institute as a genetic and flow cytometric data analyst after earning a Bachelor of Science in Bioengineering from the University of Washington in Seattle. In 2015 she earned her PhD from Harvard University upon completion of thesis research studying the genetics (including HLA fine-mapping) and cell-specific functional genomics in autoimmune diseases, under the supervision of Dr. Soumya Raychaudhuri at the Broad Institute and Brigham and Women’s Hospital. She also received an MD degree from Harvard Medical School. 

Xinli joined Pfizer in 2016 and now leads the human genetics group at Pfizer’s Inflammation and Immunology Research Unit. Her team focuses on translating genetics and epigenetics findings into evidence supporting drug targets, with an emphasis of integrating genetics with orthogonal multi-omics data types including functional genomics.
