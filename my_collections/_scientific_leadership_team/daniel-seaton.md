Daniel is a Scientific Director in the department of Human Genetics and Genomics at GSK. He leads a team developing computational methods for the interpretation of genetic and genomic data for drug discovery.

Prior to joining GSK, he was an EIPOD postdoctoral fellow at EMBL-EBI, analysing genomic data from iPS cell lines and iPS-derived cell types. This included an Open Targets project focused on Parkinson's disease, mapping eQTL in iPSC-derived dopaminergic neurons and predicting in vitro differentiation efficiency.
