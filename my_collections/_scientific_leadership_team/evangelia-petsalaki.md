Evangelia Petsalaki's research group studies human cell signalling in healthy and disease conditions. The group uses interdisciplinary approaches, including data-driven network inference, modelling of cell processes and data integration, to understand how different environmental or genetic conditions affect cell signalling responses leading to diverse cell phenotypes. 

Evangelia has a PhD in structural bioinformatics from EMBL and the University of Heidelberg (2009) and did her post doctoral work at the Lunenfeld-Tanenbaum Research Institute in Toronto, Canada (2010-2016).
