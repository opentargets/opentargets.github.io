I am currently a Senior Director in Functional Genomics at GSK. Over the course of my career, 
I have gained broad experience in pharmacology, cell biology, transcriptional control and cell signalling. 
After joining GSK in 1998, I have led several drug discovery programs and managed teams supporting assay 
development for GSK’s early-stage drug-discovery portfolio. For the last 6 years, I have been working to 
identify potential drug targets through the integration of genetic/genomic evidence with innovative 
experimental biology platforms in order to improve the quality of GSK’s drug discovery pipeline.
