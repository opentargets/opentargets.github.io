Emma Duncan joined Open Targets as a Senior Research Assistant in September 2020. 

During her PhD at Queen Mary University London, Emma studied a rare neurodegenerative disease, Autosomal Recessive Spastic Ataxia of Charlevoix Saguenay. In particular, she researched the cellular consequences of disrupted sacsin function in patient fibroblasts. 

She then pursued postdoctoral studies at the Babraham Institute's signalling department, where she focused on the autophagic protein degradation pathway. 

Now in the Open Targets Validation Lab, Emma is validating targets from large genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens in oncology.
