Our locus-to-gene (L2G) machine learning scoring method was published in Nature Genetics (<a href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.09.16.299271v2" target="_blank">the preprint is also available</a>). The L2G score reflects the likelihood that a gene is causal for the trait in question, allowing genes at trait-associated loci to be ranked by the relative strength of their evidence. It has been included in the Genetics portal since version 4.
