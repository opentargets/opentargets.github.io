Open Targets is excited to announce that <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/person/trynka-gosia//">Gosia Trynka</a>, 
our Experimental Science Director, has been awarded the 2020 Leena Peltonen prize by 
the European Society for Human Genetics (ESHG). 

The prize is given every two years to an outstanding young researcher in the field of human genetics and it 
honours the memory of <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/news_item/2010-03-11-professor-leena-peltonen-palotie-1952-2010/">Dr. Leena Peltonen</a>, a world-renowned human geneticist from Finland who contributed greatly to the 
identification of disease genes for human diseases.    

Alongside her work as a member of the <a href="/people#executive-leadership-team">Open Targets Executive Leadership Team</a>, 
Gosia has been leading the Immune Genomics Group at the Wellcome Sanger Institute since 2014. Her group combines immunology 
and genomic assays with statistical approaches to study how human genetic variation impacts the 
immune system and predisposes to the development of autoimmune diseases.
