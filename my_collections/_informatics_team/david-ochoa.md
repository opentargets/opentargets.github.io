David Ochoa joined Open Targets in 2019 as Platform Coordinator. 

David is involved in setting the scientific strategy for the OT Platform and related projects, day to day management of core database projects - including the team that generates the OT Platform - and setting priorities in line with agreed strategy together with Project Management. 

Prior to joining Open Targets, David obtained his PhD while using computational methods and network biology for predicting protein-protein interactions. After graduating, he joined as a postdoctoral fellow the group of Pedro Beltrao at EMBL-EBI to better understand human signalling under perturbation and disease by leveraging the growing body of large-scale proteomics data and the latest computational approaches in data analysis and machine learning.
