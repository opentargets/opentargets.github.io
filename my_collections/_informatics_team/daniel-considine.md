Daniel studied genetics at Queen Mary University of London (BSc) before attending Cambridge to complete his MPhil in Epidemiology. As a bioinformatician his research has involved looking at how gene and protein expression data can be leveraged to better understand breast and ovarian cancer.

As a computational biologist within the Platform's genetic analysis team, his work involves the incorporation of new genetics data sources and analyses to assist in drug target discovery.
