Szymon studied at Lodz University of Technology (BEng). He started his professional carrier in Children's Health Memorial Institute in Warsaw where he was working on the rare diseases treatment in Polish population.

Since 2021 he worked as a software developer and bioinformatician in multiple start-ups focused on drug target discovery, whole genome sequencing and clinical trials validation. As a bioinformatician his work involved looking over the connections between co-linked gene mutations and providing predictions on gene functionality.

As a senior computational biologist within the Open Targets Platform's genetic analysis team, Szymon supports and leads the development and implementation of the genetics pipelines for drug discovery and target prioritisation.
