<a href="https://blog.opentargets.org/2018/01/18/link/" target="_blank">LINK (LIterature coNcept Knowledgebase)</a> is a now-deprecated pipeline and web tool that allowed for the exploration of half a billion relations between genes, diseases, drugs, and key concepts extracted from PubMed abstracts using natural language processing. With the <a href="https://blog.opentargets.org/next-gen-platform-released/" target="_blank">launch of the next-gen Platform in April 2021</a>, we replaced LINK with a new <a href="https://platform-docs.opentargets.org/bibliography" target="_blank">Bibliography pipeline</a>.
