<a href="http://epichoose.shiny.opentargets.io/epiChoose/" target="_blank">epiChoose</a> is a now-deprecated tool for quantifying the relatedness between cell lines and primary cells. We extensively profiled a number of commonly used cell line models across a number of tissues. This profiling consists of epigenetic (histone modification, CTCF, ATAC-seq) and transcriptional (RNA-seq) whole-genome measurements.
