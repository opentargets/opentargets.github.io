<a href="http://dorothea.opentargets.io/#/" target="_blank">DoRothEA (Discriminant Regulon Expression Analysis)</a> is a web tool that can be used to search candidate TF-drug interactions in cancer. We studied the role of 127 TFs in drug sensitivity across more than 1,000 cancer cell lines screened with 265 anti-cancer compounds from the <a href="https://www.cancerrxgene.org/" target="_blank">GDSC</a>.
