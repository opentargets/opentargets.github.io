The <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eqtl/" target="_blank">eQTL Catalogue</a> provides uniformly processed gene expression and splicing QTLs from all available public studies on human. This resource focuses on expression cis-QTLs where variants are associated to expression levels of nearby genes, and on splicing QTLs where variants are associated to specific splicing events on nearby splice junctions.
