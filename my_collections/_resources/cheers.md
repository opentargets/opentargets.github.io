<a href="https://github.com/trynkaLab/CHEERS" target="_blank">CHEERS (Chromatin Element Enrichment Ranking by Specificity)</a> is a computational pipeline that determines enrichment of annotations in GWAS significant loci. In addition to SNP-peak overlap, CHEERS takes into account peak properties as reflected by quantitative changes in read counts within peaks.
