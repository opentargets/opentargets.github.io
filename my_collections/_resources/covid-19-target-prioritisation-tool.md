The COVID-19 Target Prioritisation Tool was an interactive, open source web portal that integrated molecular and clinical data from EMBL-EBI and other public resources to provide an evidence-based framework to support decision-making on potential drug targets and treatments for <a href="https://platform.opentargets.org/disease/MONDO_0100096" target="_blank">COVID-19</a>. It has now been deprecated. For more information, see <a href="https://blog.opentargets.org/2020/07/29/covid-19-target-prioritisation-tool-released/" target="_blank">our release blog post</a>.
