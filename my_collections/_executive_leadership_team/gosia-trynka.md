As Scientific Director, Gosia Trynka leads the overarching scientific direction of the consortium and deputises for the Director as required.

Gosia also leads the Immune Genomics group at the Wellcome Sanger Institute. Her group is focused on translating genetic variants associated with immune diseases to function. The group combines immune cell assays with a broad genomic toolkit (from chromatin activity mapping through large scale single cell RNA-seq studies to CRISPR screens) to understand the role of human genetic variation in regulating the immune system. 

Gosia earned her PhD in 2011 from the University of Groningen, the Netherlands under the supervision of Prof. Cisca Wijmenga. During her PhD she became actively involved in international efforts that used genome wide association studies (GWAS) to map variants predisposing to immune diseases. She then undertook postdoctoral training at Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital and the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT in Boston where she joined groups of Dr Soumya Raychaudhuri and Dr Robert Plenge. Her work included development of methods that integrate GWAS variants with functional genomics readouts to inform the role of disease associated variants, e.g. in nominating causal cell types.
