Olesya obtained her PhD in Computer Science from the University of Cambridge, where she worked on Natural Language and Information Processing. The focus of her research was argument mining for enthymemes -- arguments with one or more logical chains missing -- in naturally occuring texts. 

Originally from Baku, Azerbaijan, Olesya has experience working in industry, as a full-time software engineer in the financial sector.

She joined Open Targets in 2019 as a postdoctoral fellow, where she develops natural language processing and graph approaches for identifying novel relationships with Open Access Literature, and building a knowledge graph combining literature relationships with other evidence in the Open Targets Platform.
