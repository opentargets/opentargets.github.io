I'm a Londoner, born and raised (mostly). For my undergraduate degree, I stayed in London and studied Biological Sciences at UCL. I then followed this up with a Bioinformatics MSc at the University of Copenhagen and a PhD at the University of Cambridge.
For my PhD, I was based in the <a href="http://andersonlab.info/">Anderson group</a> at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and my thesis revolved around integrating population-scale single-cell transcriptomic data with germline genetics to better understand the biology of inflammatory bowel diseases. I joined Open Targets as a single-cell data scientist in 2024.
