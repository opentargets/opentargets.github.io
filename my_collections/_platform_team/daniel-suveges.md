Daniel obtained a PhD in structural biochemistry from Eötvös Loránd University, studying charged single alpha helices, a protein structural motif, using various biophysical methods. 

Following this, he undertook postgradual work at the Univeristy of California, San Francisco. While at UCSF, he studied the HER family of receptor tyrosine kinases that play critical roles in cancer development, establishing an experimental in vitro system to study structure-function relationships of these proteins.

He has been working as a Senior Bioinformatician on the Wellcome Genome Campus since 2015, first within the Wellcome Sanger Institute's Analytical Genomics of Complex Traits research group, then in EMBL-EBI's GWAS Catalog developr team. 

He now leads the data team at Open Targets, who develop and maintain the data processing and integration pipelines, and actively develop our data models to ensure Open Targets' informatics tools provide the most relevant answers to our users.
