Hannah Nicholls recently completed her PhD at Queen Mary University of London. Her PhD focused on machine learning applications to better understand the genetics of cardiovascular disease - specifically applying machine learning to prioritise disease genes from genome-wide association studies. 

With a background in medical sciences and experience in wet lab research, Hannah transitioned to bioinformatics during her MRes+PhD programme. She has since worked on a range of projects that utilise machine learning to solve biomedical problems.

As a senior bioinformatician in the Open Targets Genetics team, Hannah aims to use statistical and machine learning approaches to develop new functionality and features that enhance Open Targets Genetics.
