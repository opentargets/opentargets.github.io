A Senior Bioinformatician role funded by Open Targets is available at the Wellcome Sanger Institute under the leadership of Dr. Maya Ghoussaini. This is an exciting opportunity for you to participate in the enhancement of the <a href="https://genetics.opentargets.org/" target="_blank">Open Targets Genetics Portal</a> through the development of new functionality and features using state of the art statistical genetics analysis. You will actively engage in the integration of data from several genetic analyses including rare variant association analyses, burden tests in large-scale datasets such as the UK Biobank, and tissue enrichment analyses.
