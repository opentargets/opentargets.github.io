We are looking for a highly-motivated, self-driven person to join <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/groups/trynka-faculty" target="_blank">Gosia Trynka's</a> and 
<a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/groups/davenport-group" target="_blank">Emma Davenportâ€™s</a> research groups at the Wellcome Sanger Institute and provide experimental support for our single cell RNA-seq studies. As a part of an interdisciplinary team of experimentalists, computational biologists, clinical and industry collaborators you will lead the generation of a large scale single cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) dataset from 500 healthy donors and immune disease patients. We will integrate the scRNA-seq with genotyping data to map expression quantitative trait loci eQTLs at the single cell level (sceQTLs). This is an exciting opportunity to be engaged in all aspects of a large scale project, from planning to large scale data generation, analysis and novel discoveries. Our goal is to accelerate drug discovery by integrating immune disease GWAS variants with the sceQTL maps generated in this project to identify the most promising therapeutic targets for follow up by the industry partners working closely with us.
