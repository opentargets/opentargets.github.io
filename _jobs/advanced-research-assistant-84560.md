The <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/groups/garnett-group" target="_blank"> Garnett lab</a> at the Wellcome Sanger Institute are seeking an Advanced Research Assistant to work on a project that will identify novel vulnerabilities in cancer cells that are resistant to existing therapies.

You will have the opportunity to utilize a wide range of cutting-edge molecular and cellular biology skills necessary for gene editing, CRISPR-Cas9 screening, and drug target validation

<b>About the project:</b>

The emergence of drug resistance is a major limitation to the long-term success of cancer therapies. Drug resistance is often caused by acquired genetic alterations in cancer cells. The aim of this project is to use high-throughput CRISPR-Cas9 screening in drug-resistant cancer cell lines to identify acquired vulnerabilities. This approach will identify novel drug targets for the treatment of patients with drug-resistant cancers. This project will focus on tackling resistance to targeted therapies, including cancer immunotherapies.
