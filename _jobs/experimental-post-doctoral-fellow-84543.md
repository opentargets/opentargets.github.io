A position is now available for a highly motivated Postdoctoral Fellow to join the research group of Ana Cvejic, Peter Campbell and Open Targets partners at the Wellcome Sanger Institute (WSI).

The project will combine state-of-the-art single-cell data generation with spatial transcriptomics to study the spatial distribution of diverse immune cells in cancer, and discover putative cell-cell interactions across the tumour microenvironment. It will utilise an array of in vitro tumour assays to examine the role of newly identified genes in tumour growth in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A particular focus will be on target genes expressed on myeloid cells that facilitate their interactions with tumour cells as well as other immune cells.

This position could be based at the Wellcome Sanger Institute or at the University of Cambridge in Ana Cvejic's lab.
