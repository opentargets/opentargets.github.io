The UniProt resource is one of the most internationally used protein databases serving a large and diverse research community in genomics, proteins and proteomics. In this role, you will develop a framework to enhance the annotations on human protein amino acids to predict the impact of missense variants, and link these to disease via genetic associations. This framework will be used to propose novel candidate drug targets and will deliver a new service to study variation for the scientific community. You will be working with highly skilled software engineers and talented scientists in the world-leading UniProt protein resource and the innovative Open Targets platform.
