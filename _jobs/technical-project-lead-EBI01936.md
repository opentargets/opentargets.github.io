We are looking for a Technical Project Lead to join our team at EMBL-EBI. We are open to applicants at different career stages, but we are keen to find someone who embraces cutting-edge technologies to tackle complex challenges in drug discovery and informatics.

As a key member of the <a href="https://www.opentargets.org/platform#platform-team">Open Targets Platform team</a>, you will design and build cloud-first software tailored for the interface between large-scale biomedical data and drug discovery. Together with the other Open Targets partners (BMS, GSK, Sanofi and Wellcome Sanger Institute) you will lead the technical strategy of current and future informatics tools designed to support the identification and prioritisation of drug targets. Using cutting-edge technologies and leveraging the expertise of our product owners and industry stakeholders, you will work in a dynamic, multidisciplinary, international environment to tackle a wide range of algorithmic and technical challenges. 

Our open-source codebases power our flagship applications, the <a href="https://platform.opentargets.org">Open Targets Platform</a> and the <a href="https://genetics.opentargets.org">Open Targets Genetics  Portal</a>. To help our users answer their research questions, harmonised data generated by experts in different scientific domains is consumed by our ETL pipelines written in Scala and Spark. The data ingested to ElasticSearch and ClickHouse is later served by our GraphQL APIs using the Play framework and consumed by our React-based web interface. All applications are deployed and served in Google Cloud Platform using Terraform. Additionally, all compute processes across our teams are performed in Google Compute Engine. And lastly, all resulting datasets are made available for academic and commercial use through different channels including Google BigQuery.
