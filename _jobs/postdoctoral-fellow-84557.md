The <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/group/adams-group/" target="_blank">Adams</a> and <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/group/trynka-faculty/" target="_blank">Trynka</a> labs are world-leaders in studying the genetics of cancer and the immune system using gene editing, single cell sequencing, and computational analyses. They work together as a multidisciplinary team of wet-lab experimental and data scientists to generate and analyse biological datasets to address the fundamental biological question of how genetic variation contributes to diseases such as cancer and immune disorders and also drug responses and drug resistance.

To support an Open Targets research project led by both labs, we are seeking a Postdoctoral Fellow to deploy saturation genome editing to understand the function of cancer and immune genes at single nucleotide resolution. You will have the opportunity to work at the leading edge of experimental functional genomics and collaborate with our academic and industry partners on translational research.
