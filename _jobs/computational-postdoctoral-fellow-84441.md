We have an opportunity for a postdoctoral fellow to join us under the leadership of <a href="https://www.stemcells.cam.ac.uk/people/pi/cvejic" target="_blank">Dr Ana Cvejic (University of Cambridge)</a> and <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/group/cancer-genome-project/" target="_blank">Peter Campbell (Wellcome Sanger Institute)</a>. In this project, you will analyse newly generated single cell (scRNA-Seq and scATAC-Seq) as well as novel and spatial transcriptomics data sets (In Situ Sequencing and 10x Visium) to understand the molecular properties of immune cells infiltrating tumour sites. The underlying data sets comprise thousands of unique molecular signals measured for tens of thousands of cells or physical locations in each tumour. You will employ methods from high dimensional and spatial statistics, and machine learning, to chart and understand the nature of different tumour-associated immune cells, how they interact and change biological functions and how the underlying molecular changes could be exploited as therapeutic targets.
