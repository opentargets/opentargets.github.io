We are seeking an Advanced Research Assistant to join the <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/group/high-throughput-spatial-genomics/" target="_blank">High Throughput Spatial Genomics (HTSG) team</a> within the <a href="https://www.sanger.ac.uk/group/bayraktar-group/" target="_blank">Bayraktar research group</a>. You will perform laboratory work in spatial genomics to support cutting edge research projects on human tissues, including tumor samples as part of an Open Targets funded project. 

You will participate in exciting projects to spatially map the cellular environments of human tissues in health and disease. Your primary role will be to perform daily laboratory work on 1) human tissue preservation and sectioning, 2) high multiplexed in situ hybridisation (In Situ Sequencing) and 3) confocal microscopy. You will use multiple sample and data trackers to carefully keep track of important experimental metadata. You will be involved in supporting the day-to-day management of the lab, including monitoring lab resources, reporting equipment/experiment faults, and assist in trouble-shooting.
