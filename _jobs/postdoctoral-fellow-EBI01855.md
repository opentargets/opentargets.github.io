An exciting opportunity has been created for a talented scientist to work on the development of novel computational and informatics methods to improve target selection decision-making in drug discovery. The position is funded by Open Targets, the <a href="https://druggablegenome.net/" target="_blank">Illuminating the Druggable Genome (IDG) project</a> and <a href="https://www.kespine.org.uk/" target="_blank">UK SPINE</a>. 

Based at the European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) but working closely with all partners the appointee will develop computational and informatics methods that exploit the data integrated in the <a href="https://www.targetvalidation.org/" target="_blank">Open Targets Platform</a> and <a href="https://pharos.nih.gov/" target="_blank">IDGâ€™s Pharos resource</a> together with other public resources as applicable. These two resources incorporate an ever-expanding wealth of data and information pertaining to the link between target and disease phenotype, target tractability, potential safety risks and other relevant factors. The overall goal of the Open Targets-IDG project is to develop methods and insights that exploit these platforms to help drive decisions on target identification and prioritisation in the wider drug discovery and bioscience community. The UK SPINE component of the project provides an excellent opportunity to apply these concepts to diseases of ageing, working within a tight network of experimental, clinical and informatics experts to identify disease hypotheses and have these translate into experimental work.
