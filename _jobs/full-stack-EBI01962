We are looking for an enthusiastic and talented Full Stack Developer to join the Open Targets Genetics Core team.
The postholderâ€™s primary tasks will be the active development of the genetics portal to integrate new data provided 
by the genetics team, and to ensure a reliable and responsive user interface. The genetics portal shares a common infrastructure
with the Open Targets platform, based on React web applications and GraphQL APIs. The postholder will join a fast-paced, startup-like environment,
where the latest technologies in front-end development and data visualisation are exploited to influence decisions in the drug discovery area.
We are looking for a highly motivated developer who will help us bring our user-facing services to the next level.
