We are seeking an enthusiastic and motivated research assistant to provide experimental, scientific, and operational support to the <a href="https://www.stemcells.cam.ac.uk/people/pi/cvejic" target="_blank">Cvejic Lab</a>. As a member of the Cvejic Lab, you will work closely with other members of the team to facilitate single-cell research to the Cvejic Lab and generate experimental evidence to meet our project aims. You will mainly perform histological procedures such as fixation, embedding, sectioning and staining of human samples for downstream analysis. Furthermore, you will often assist with processing human samples for single-cell RNA sequencing, multiome, spatial transcriptomics and in vitro assays.  You will have the opportunity to learn and utilise state-of-the-art phenotyping methodologies, such as scRNAseq, scATACseq, FACS and high-content imaging.
