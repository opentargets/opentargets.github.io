We are looking for an enthusiastic and talented Bioinformatician to join the Open Targets team. 
Open Targets (OT) is a public-private partnership aiming to systematically identify and prioritise drug targets by 
integrating complex biological data in a pre-competitive environment. As an open source project, the Open Targets platform (https://platform.opentargets.org) and 
Genetics Portal (http://genetics.opentargets.org) organise and present large amounts of biomedical data, 
in order to publicly facilitate the drug discovery decision-making process.
