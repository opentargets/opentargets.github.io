We are looking for an enthusiastic and talented scientist with experience in drug target selection processes and an 
interest in diverse disease areas to join the Open Targets team. 
The postholderâ€™s primary tasks will be to drive the development and maintenance of highly annotated drug target lists that integrate our growing 
experimental data with public domain data and prioritisation information. This will require collaboration across multiple Open Targets groups 
and interaction with Drug Discovery scientists in our partners to synthesise best practice approaches in different therapy areas.
