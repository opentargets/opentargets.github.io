We are looking for an Advanced Research Assistant to join our experimental project team. This is an exciting opportunity to apply single cell genomics to cells isolated from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) or healthy control patients. The goal of the project is to identify genetic variants that are associated with gene expression in intestinal cells, and then combine these with data from genetic studies of IBD patients to identify potential novel drug targets for IBD.
