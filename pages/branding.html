        <h3>Using the Open Targets logo and name</h3>
        <p>
          The name of our organisaiton in printed publications is "Open Targets".
          In our logo, without exception, the name "Open Targets" is placed to the right of, and in a defined ratio to, the Open Targets helix.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <p>
          You must obtain consent before using the Open Targets logo in any public forum, and the images may not be modified. To do so, or if you require further information or alternative versions of the logo, please contact outreach@opentargets.org.
        </p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h3>Elements of the Open Targets logo</h3>
        <p>
          The logo is made up of two elements:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Image mark: a helix made up of four rectangles with one rounded edge, balanced on one of its points</li>
          <li>Word mark: "Open Targets"</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The word and image mark together make up the Open Targets logo. The image mark may be used by itself in certain circumstances. The work mark must not be used by itself.</p>
        <br/>
        <br/>
        <h3>Logo spacing</h3>
        <p>
          The logo should have free space around it, so that it does not touch adjacent elements or the edges of the screen or page.
        </p>
