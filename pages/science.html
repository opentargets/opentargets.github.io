          At Open Targets, we are improving how targets are selected for drug discovery. 
        </p>

        <h3>Target selection</h3>
        <p>
          Drugs against genetically validated targets are more likely to progress through clinical trials. The influx of 
          new data from modern genetics and genomics allows targets to be assessed in a comprehensive genome-wide context. 
          In addition, feasibility of new technologies in gene editing, single cell sequencing and cell models allow new 
          types of data to be generated to inform target selection.
        </p> 
        <p><strong>
          We bring these approaches together in an integrated pre-competitive research programme. 
        </strong></p> 
        <p>
          We consider target selection to encompass two key steps, target identification and target prioritisation. 
          Target identification defines targets with significant associations to the disease biology. Target prioritisation 
          refines the list of targets on the strength of the association evidence and additional target and disease parameters 
          such as target tractability by drug modality, and likely target-based safety risks. We work together with scientists 
          across our partner organisations to identify areas where our research programme will enhance target identification 
          and prioritisation either by integrating and analysing data, or by generating new data in our therapeutic areas of 
          interest.

        <p>
          Our research programme generates and analyses data to connect targets to diseases, assess the strength of this evidence, and help identify and prioritise targets for drug discovery. This includes evidence that causally links targets and diseases, as well as foundational data that helps us understand biological processes and disease progression more deeply.
        </p>
        <p>
          Within the research programme, we combine whole genome approaches and high throughput methods to address the full range of relevant targets in disease in the most relevant cellular systems. We use the expertise of all our partners in emerging and established technologies, focusing on three therapy areas to generate new understanding:

          Our core bioinformatics work focusses on bringing together the various, relevant data on targets to allow simple and seamless exploration 
          by drug discovery scientists. We cover many data types relevant to human disease biology and target identification using the expertise from 
          Open Targets partners and beyond.

        <h4>Open Targets Platform</h4>
        <p class="mb-5">
          Our overall approach to target identification and prioritisation is brought to life in the 
          <a href="https://platform.opentargets.org" target="_blank">Open Targets Platform</a>, which integrates public data relevant to the association 
          between targets and diseases, and provides additional data and tools for prioritisation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Platform is  <a href="https://github.com/opentargets/platform" target="_blank">an open source project</a> and will continue to 
          evolve as we bring new features and data to bear. Explore the Platform at <a href="https://platform.opentargets.org" target="_blank">platform.opentargets.org</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>Open Targets Genetics</h4>
        <p class="mb-5">
          We developed <a href="https://genetics.opentargets.org/" target="_blank">Open Targets Genetics</a> 
          to provide causal target assignments underlying each association for Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS). Notably, Open Targets Genetics features a machine learning model to assign each association at a locus to the most likely causal gene based on integrated genetics and functional genomics data; this analysis is one of the sources of genetic evidence in the Open Targets Platform.

        </p>
        <h4>Other bioinformatics services and tools</h4>
        <p>          
          Additional ancillary projects in the area of bioinformatics include development of the <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eqtl/" target="_blank">eQTL Catalogue</a>, 
          network analysis for drug target list expansion, and enhanced data for the Open Targets Platform, including additional data from clinical trial records and data 
          on the effect of mutations on protein function. We also release and support standalone informatics tools associated with our various 
          projects. <a href="/resources">Explore our informatics tools</a>.
