          Complementary institutions have joined Open Targets and are working together to improve how we systematically 
          identify and prioritise drug targets.  Working together, they can focus their expertise to build resources and projects 
          that are greater than the sum of their parts.

          We also collaborate with other groups with similar philosophies and complementary expertise on specific projects where we

          the University of Tartu, and the University of Oxford among others.
