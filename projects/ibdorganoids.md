The activity of immune cells is carefully controlled by the balanced expression of inhibitory and activating receptors and ligands. In particular identification of targets that enhance the function of innate immune cells, such as Natural Killer (NK) cells, could allow the treatment of malignancies with a lower mutational burden. In many circumstances the ligand-receptor pairs used by NK cells for activation and inhibition are not known, and as the majority of immune cell surface receptors exhibit promiscuous binding it is highly likely that additional receptor interactions are yet to be defined.

We plan to screen up to 50 of NK cell receptors and shared receptors found on immune cells, including many that are currently orphan receptors, to provide a comprehensive catalogue of receptor–ligand interactions. 

We will do this with a technology from Retrogenix (www.retrogenix.com) a cell based microarray technology using native human proteins. In the screen HEK293 cells are spotted onto a microarray and transient expression of the cell surface proteins is achieved via cDNA transfection – at present 4,500 cell surface proteins are expressed in the microarray (estimated >75% coverage). The extracellular domain of the receptors of interest are expressed with an Fc tag and the purified proteins applied to the microarray to detect cells that express a target ligand.

We will validate the interactions discovered using CRISPR-Cas9 knockout and/or overexpression to functionally test identified ligands for their ability to modulate NK activation using cancer cells as targets in particular taking advantage of the highly annotated collection of cancer cell lines established at WTSI.

This knowledge will potentially enable second line checkpoint therapies with greater efficacy, in wider patient populations that are not responsive to current checkpoint inhibitors and facilitate an understanding of how the innate immune system may be directed towards tumour cell killing whilst controlling the potential adverse event profile.
